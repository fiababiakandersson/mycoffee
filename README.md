# MY COFFEE
My Coffee is a coffeeguide where you can search for coffee and add your favourites to your "My Coffee-list". 
You can also get information like description and ingredients for all the individual coffees. 

We put only one error boundry around the layout because it's the only part that is likely to get error. 
Header and footer are dumb components. 

# Run My Coffee
